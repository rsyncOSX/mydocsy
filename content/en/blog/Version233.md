### Version 2.3.3 (build 133) - 12 February 2025

See version 2.3.4.

From this release, the automatic creation of the signing and notarization certificates for RsyncUI.app and the dmg file is enabled by the make command. Previously, the release builds were created using Xcode, but it is more convenient to build everything using a makefile.
