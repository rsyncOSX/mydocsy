RsyncUI is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. This means that the app is verified and checked for not containing malicious code and it will work with Apples Gatekeeper technology. A message from Apple is issued when opening either a new or updated application the first time.

[Notarizing is required for all software](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing_your_app_before_distribution).
