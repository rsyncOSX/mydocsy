My e-mail is: <thomeven@gmail.com>, if you have any ideas or thougths about RsyncUI, please drop me an e-mail.
**RsyncOSX** was archived and development stopped in August 2024. **RsyncUI** is in active development. All experience I
have from developing RsyncOSX, are used in the development of RsyncUI.

The development of RsyncOSX commenced early in 2016 as a personal project to learn Swift.
And the development of RsyncUI began late in 2020 to learn SwiftUI.

I have a master's degree in computing science, but I am
not a *professional developer*. I did my master's in the days when Linux was released in 1991 and the Internet became a public
service. And a few years ahead of that, in 1989, the Web was invented at Cern.

There is one developer only, me, and I am doing what I can to keep RsyncUI as stable and user-friendly as possible.
I am not a UI designer, and some users might find the UI complicated and less user-friendly.
The maintenance and development of RsyncUI is one of my hobbies. If you like using RsyncUI, please consider giving me a
star on the GitHub repository. Every single star is motivation for me to continue development of RsyncUI.

In May 2022, I retired from work at the age of 62. I am [a passionate photographer](https://photosbythomas.netlify.app/) ofÂ birds and love staying in the Norwegian mountains. Grandkids, photography, development of RsyncUI and cross-country skiing are some activities which keep me busy.

#### A few words about the code

Even though I am an educated IT person, most of my professional work has been as an IT manager and not a developer.
Most of my coding experience is with private projects such as RsyncUI and RsyncOSX. Google is and has been a great resource for
research and advice on how to solve specific problems. Reading about other developers code and discussions are very
valuable input for me.

I am learning almost every day and by every new release of Swift, SwiftUI and Xcode there are new features to learn.
All major changes and updates are updated in the [changelog](/docs/changelog/). I am also using tools
like [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)
and [periphery](https://github.com/peripheryapp/periphery) to assist me in developing code.

#### No right or wrong

I believe there is no *right* or *wrong* in development. There are literally hundreds of guidelines out there for writing code.
But each developer and team chooses their way to develop based on their skills and what they want to achieve. What I also
experience is how my own understanding of OO, declarative programming, Swift and SwiftUI is growing. I would not write code
today as I did when I commenced my project in 2015. But still, I am not a professional developer, and there are several
topics within Swift and SwiftUI that I do not understand. But I am capable of learning; if I spend enough time on a topic,
there is a good probability that I will get the idea.

#### Why not App Store

One important requirement for macOS apps on Apple App Store is quote Apple:
*"To distribute a macOS app through the Mac App Store, you must enable the App Sandbox capability."*
There are restrictions what an app can do inside the App Sandbox. Execute *rsync*, obvious, and enable passwordless
login by ssh to remote servers are two must have features. The Apple Sandbox causes a few issues to both features when
switch on. And I have not yet any success when RsyncUI is set to use default rsync in macOS and only attached discs.

#### How are these pages built?

Hugo, which is a static site generator, is the web framework serving these pages. The source for this website is hosted on GitHub.
Netlify, which runs the web server, automatically picks up changes on the main branch and rebuilds the server.
The Hugo theme is [docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy), another open-source project hosted on GitHub.
Every time I change or add pages, I commit the changes to GitHub, and Netlify automatically builds the new server in seconds.
