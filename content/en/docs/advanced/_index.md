There are a few more or less advanced features in RsyncUI. If you are new to RsyncUI, new to rsync, it is adviced to learn the basics before utilizing the more advanced features.

#### Halting tasks

By right-clicking on a task, *on column Synchronize ID or Task*, it can be halted or released from halted status. A halted task will be marked and not available for estimate or execute. When releasing a task from halted status, it remember which kind of task it was before halted. 

#### RsyncUI widgets (URL commands)

Two widgets are embedded in RsyncUI: 

- one for *estimating and synchronizing*
- and the second for *verifying remote* repository

Both widgets retrieve a saved URL link from storage. Within the Tasks view, there is a view for URLs. Within this view, you can save the required URLs. The widgets display whether a validated URL is present. To enable the widgets on macOS, click on the date and time icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Edit the widgets and select RsyncUI. Then, add the widgets.

After enabling the widgets, a single click on the widget will launch RsyncUI and execute the corresponding action. To modify the URLs, update and save the new URLs.
