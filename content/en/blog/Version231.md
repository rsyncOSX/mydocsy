### Version 2.3.1 (build 131) - not yet released

A version 2.3.1 of RsyncUI will be released in early February 2025. This update includes a minor change to widgets and the implementation of a URL validation mechanism before saving.  And there are a few internal refactor of code as well.

**Widgets** 

After enable and save URLs, in Tasks View URLs, the widgets look like below.

**Hide The Sidebar**

The sidebar might be hidden. When hidden, the view is cleaner. When hidden, to select another profile, choose the new *list icon* on the toolbar. The sidebar can be hidden on/off by menu or by shortcut, see *View* on menu bar. Or by click on the toolbar icon. All functions for estimate, synchronize and action by URLs are working as expected when the Sidebar is hidden.
