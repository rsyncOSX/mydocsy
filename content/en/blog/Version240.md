### Version 2.4.x (build 14x) - work in progress

There is also a release candidate for version 2.4.x. The release candidate is updated when there are new updates. This version is expected to be released by the end of March or the beginning of April 2025. The primary repository on GitHub is always updated with the latest development.

#### Tagging of data to be synchronized

It is imperative that RsyncUI tags tasks with data to be synchronized correctly. If the tagging fails, there may be local data that is not synchronized. RsyncUI supports the latest version of rsync and the older default version of rsync included in macOS 14 and macOS 15. There is a new function for parsing output from rsync in version 2.4.x.

####  GUI updates

The Parameters view for rsync is consolidated into one view which includes, pr task, user added parameters for rsync, ssh parameters, backup switch and remove parameters.  The `--delete` parameter is from this version **not** a default parameter for new tasks. But, the `--delete` parameter may be added within the *Parameters for rsync* view.

And there is some cleanup within the *Add and update tasks* view as well.

### Future plans for RsyncUI

What is the future for the development of RsyncUI? Following the release of version 2.4.x, the next version is likely to be released **after** the summer 2025. Of course, any bugs reported will be fixed. The spring and summer are quite busy as a bird photographer. After the release of version 2.4.x, I will focus on my other major hobby, bird photography. You can find a link to some of my photos on my [GitHub site](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/).

However, I have some plans for the next major version of RsyncUI. By URL or Deep Links, RsyncUI will support loading any profile, estimating and executing synchronization of data. The next major version of RsyncUI will  most likely include a *calendar and scheduling of tasks*.  And, if you have any questions for me, donÂ´t hesitate to contact me by email thomeven@gmail.com.
