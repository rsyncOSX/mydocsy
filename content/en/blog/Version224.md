### Version 2.2.4 (build 126) - not yet released

Next feature in RsyncUI is *deep links*. Deep links enables direct access to application features by using
URL links. Notepad can store URLÂ´s. By using deep links, enables by one click only, to excute an estimate and synchronize action.

The main repository is updated with the latest development, including code for deep links. Be aware that the deep link code may be unstable (yet). All code for deep links are separated from other code in RsyncUI. Normal use of RsyncUI does not involve any deep link code. This secure there are no sideeffects in integrating deep links in RsyncUI. The rest of the code base is stable, version 2.2.3 code. 

Utilizing  deep links in RsyncUI is *grouping together* actions which normally are two ore more actions activated by user input.
